I wanted to count how many robux I saved buying free heads that will eventually change price

To recreate this:

Make sure to have the BTR Extension on your browser since this works with the "Item Owned" feature that displays a green circle with inside a checkmark that lets you know that you own that item

Go to this link:
https://www.roblox.com/catalog?Category=4&Subcategory=66&CurrencyType=3&pxMin=1&salesTypeFilter=1

Or simply go to the Catalog/Marketplace, drop down the Heads menu, click Heads again, on Price set Min to 1 and press Go

Load every head by scrolling until the bottom, if some checkmarks doesn't pop up but you are sure that you own that item, refresh the page and try again

Open up the console using the short cut CTRL + Shift + I

In the textbox paste the code from this repository and press Enter.

You should now be able to see how many robux you "saved" and the amount of free items that you bought that now costs. You could do the same with characters.

To also print the name of every head found, on line 24 remove the //
To prevent the code from deleting all the elements that you don't own, comment with // the line 6
